## Issues:
-1- The constructor name different from the class name
-2- The code is missing the import statements for BufferedWriter, FileWriter, and Math classes. These classes should be imported at the beginning of the file to resolve the compilation errors
-3- The catch block now includes a specific catch for the IOException type. This allows for specific handling of IO-related exceptions and a generic catch block is included to catch any other unexpected exceptions. It will print the error message along with the exception's message
-4- How to access variables
-5- Remove else continue
